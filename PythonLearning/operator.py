print (3 - 4)
print (3 * 4)
print (3 / 4)
print (3 % 2)
print (3 ** 4) # 3 to the fourth power
print (3 // 4) #floor division

# Assignment Operators
# Unlike Java, C# and C++. Python doesnt allow ++
a = 0
a+=2  # Will add two to the variable a
print (a)

a-=1  # Will subtract one to the variable a
print (a)

# Python for loops
# A bit different then other languages
# Basic for loop that loops through a range of values betwen 1 and 3
